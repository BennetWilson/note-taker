  ## Description 
  
  I was tasked with creating a Note-Taker using express in JS.

  I created three GETs, one POST, one DELETE and one LISTEN.

  I used UUID to create unique ID's for every new entry. I used this ID to target which item of the array I want to delete.

  I use writeFileSync to actually delete the entry from the db.json
